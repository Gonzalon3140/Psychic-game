 Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. 
 
 You have to Guess what letter I'm thinking of
 Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
 Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
 Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
 Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. This will be displayed until the user either wins or loses.)
 When the player wins, the game will increase the Wins counter and the game will start over again.
 When the player loses, the game will increase the Losses counter and restart the game.
 
This app uses basic Javascript and uses Html along with CSS.  
It also has a package.json so that it can be deployed to Heroku
